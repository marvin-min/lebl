indefinite article 不定冠词, 例如 a, an
english explanation: not clear or exact.
example: Teachers find the report’s terminology so indefinite that it is confusing.


definite article: 指代性明确的
clearly known, seen, stated.

a word used before a noun to show whether the noun refers to a particular example of something or to a general example of something. In English, ‘the’ is called the definite article and ‘a’ and ‘an’ are called the indefinite article.



noun: 名词

a word or group of words that represent a person, a place, a thing or activity, or a quality or idea(such as danger or happiness). Noun can be used as the subject or object of a verb(as in 'teacher arrived' or we like the teacher') or as the object of a preposition(As in 'good at football')

adj(adjective): 形容词
a word that describes a noun or pronoun. in the phrase "black hat", "black" is an adjective and in the sentence 'it makes her happy",'happy' is an adjective.


pre(preposition),介词

a word that is used before noun, or gerund to show place, time direction etc. in the phrase 'the trees in the part', 'in' is preposition.

粗略来说，介词（preposition）用来介绍引出名词，比如He is at the station中的at是为了介绍引出后面的the station。介词就像一个介绍人一样介绍引出了后面的名词。

adverb(副词)
副词（adverb）用来修饰限定动词、形容词、副词、以及整句话（有些副词甚至还可以修饰名词），比如He jumped up中的up用来修饰前面的动词jumped。单独一个词很难区分它是介词还是副词，因为比如上面的up既可以做副词也可以做介词。但是在句子中就容易一些了，删掉副词之后句子语法上还是正确的，但是删掉介词之后句子就说不通了或者意思全变了。比如上面的He jumped up删掉副词up之后成为He jumped，句子依然成立，只是没有up修饰之后jump的方向就不得而知了；但是He is at the station中的介词at一旦删掉之后成为He is the station之后就说不通了。
